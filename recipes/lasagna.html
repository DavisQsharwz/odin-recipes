      Lasagna is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very
      wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of
      stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragu, bechamel
      sauce, vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings and spices for more

        Classic, homemade lasagna is pure comfort food, and while it takes a little effort to put together, it's easy to cook and feeds a crowd. This traditional lasagna recipe has a simple meat and tomato sauce that's alternated with gooey cheese and noodles for an irresistible dish.

The meat sauce is made first and can easily be done ahead of time. After simmering, cool and store in the fridge for up to a day before layering the lasagna. From there, it only takes minutes to boil the noodles and assemble the dish before baking until bubbly. Fresh, sliced mozzarella takes this lasagna to the next level.

Lasagna needs little accompaniment. Serve slices with a fresh green salad for a color and texture contrast. Or, for a feast, serve with garlic bread.
